# Introduction {#sec:intro}

This is document is meant to provide a very simplified idea of the curve that
translates the progression of the COVID-19 virus spreading in Portugal. As
dataset grows (the number of samples increases) the graphics are increasingly
trustworthy.

Please keep in mind that is a gross simplification of the subject.

The curve that is present is the exponencial approximation to the provided
dataset.

I assume that as long as we're below the pure exponencial curve (we're sort of
fine).
